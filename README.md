# Simple MapReduce

This is a project to build simple *mapreduce*[[1](#ref1)] app with *C++* using *MPI*[[2](#ref2)].
(some APIs namings are referred from *Apache Hadoop*[[link](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/)])

### Disclaimer

Mapreduce built at this project may not be a right structured.
This is built based on paper [[2](#ref1)], but I may take wrong some parts.
Additionally, this is tested with several texts with word counting tasks
but not fully tested, so it may have bugs.

## <a name="2-setup"></a>2 Setup
### 2.1 Install dependencies

This needs to install `cmake`, `g++ (>=9)` and `mpi`.
(In this project, `OPEN_MPI` is used.)

If use `open-mpi`, run the following command,
```sh
# on Ubuntu
$ sudo apt install g++ cmake openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
```

Optionally, you can use `libtbb-dev` on Ubuntu 20.04.

If you use alternatives such as `MPICH`, check their website and install it manually.
(tested on Ubuntu Docker container locally with `mpich-3.4.1`)

### 2.2 Network settings
This project is run with 2 PCs to check performance. The result is described at [section4](#4-performance).

If you want to connect other machines, use `NFS` and set the shared directory, then run from there.
However, this requires additional tasks for network settings or configurations, such as SSH settings. Documentation says MPI uses arbitorary ports so to make it easier, temporarily turn off firewall.
(for OPEN-MPI, see [FAQ](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running))

Once conneced machines to the same network, need to set host machines.
The host list should be stored in `./conf/host_file`.
If use the script from the next section to run the operation, the file name and hte location must match.

### 3.1 Initial build

Before starting all tasks, need to build mapreduce library first.
In order to do that, run the following script in shell:
```sh
# at root directory
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

or, if you want to build both library and executable(see section 3.2),
run the following instead:
```sh
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DSIMPLEMR_BUILD_APP=ON ..
$ make -j
```

### 3.2 Example task (Word count)

As an example task, the popular preprocessing steps "word count" is adopted,
because it is simple and easy to implement, but good for checking performances.

The tokenizing processes are:

  - Remove punctuations
  - Split by space or tabs

The word counting app itself is located at `./app/word_count.cc`.

Note that, in the app script, relative paths are used
so that it needs to follow the commands below otherwise crash when execute the code.

```sh
$ cd app
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

then, this will generate `run_task` in root directory,
so change directory to root and execute `run_task` with *MPI*.

```sh
# change directory to root
$ cd ../..
$ mpirun [options] ./run_task

# for instance,
# use all node on the local machine
$ mpirun ./run_task
# use machines set in `host_file` and 4 nodes in total
$ mpirun -np 4 --hostfile host_file ./run_task
```

If you need root privilages to execute `mpirun`, create a user and run with `su -c`.

Note that if the environment has **only 1 core available**, similar to following error will raise:

```
... (some error messages)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] [2021-01-23 12:34:56.789] No worker node is provieded. Aborting...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
... (some error messages)
```

The process will be aborted if only 1 core is available to avoid hanging.
So make sure your environment has multicores available.


### 3.3 Run on Docker

If you would like to run the task on Docker container, execute `run_docker` script as following:

```sh
$ ./run_docker --input ./inputs --output ./outputs

# if you want to remove image after finished task
$ ./run_docker -i ./inputs -o ./outputs --rmi
```

(Note: currently running on a single container)

### 3.4 Custom task

The structure is following:
```cpp
// app/custom_mr.cpp
#include "mapreduce.h"

using namespace mapreduce;

class SomeMapper : public Mapper<key_type, value_type>
{
 public:
  void map(const std::string &input, const Context &context)
  {
    /// do something

    /// output mapping via context.write(key_type, value_type)
    context.write(key, value);  // this is for sending data
  }

class SomeReducer : public Reducer<mapped_key_type,
                                   mapped_value_type,
                                   output_key_type,
                                   output_value_type>
{
 public:
  void reduce(const std::string &key, const std::vector<long> &value,
              const Context &context)
  {
    /// do something

    /// for summation or calculating mean
    /// RESUCE_SUM() and REDUCE_MEAN() can be used respectively
    /// See `app/word_count.cc` as an example

    /// output the result via context.write(output_key_type, output_value_type)
    context.write(key, value);  // this is for sending data
  }
}

int main(int &, char *[])
{
  FileFormat fmt{};
  fmt.add_input_path("./inputs");
  fmt.set_output_path("./outputs");

  Job<SomeMapper, SomeReducer> job{};
  job.set_file_format(fmt);

  job.run();  // execute mapreduce task

  return 0;
}
```

Put every scripts in `./app` directory. 
Then, update `app/sourcelist.cmake` like the following:
```
# list all related source/header files
target_sources(main PRIVATE
  ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/app/custom_mr.cpp
              :
)
```

Note that currently `key_type` only accepts `std::string`
and `value_type` accepts either `int` or `long`.

## <a name="4-performance"></a>4 Performance

To check the performance, tested with simple word counting task described in "Execution example" section with publicly available dataset.
The dataset used in this performance testing is "Large Movie Review Dataset"[\[3\]](#ref3) ([link](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/))
which consists of 25,000 files for training, 25,000 files for testing and 50,000 unlabeled files.

The data size is in total 132.0 MB.

### 4.1 Preprocessing

In order to utilize parallel processing, merged several files into a file by following rules:

  - make groups in each group(train/test) and each category(pos/neg/unsup)
  - group files by the first letter (e.g. `1*.txt` will be group 1)

In short, files in pos groups in train dataset starting with "5" is going to be `train_pos_5.txt`,
therefore, some files has large size, and some are small such as starting with "0".

Now, in total, there are 50 files (pos/neg/unsup in train and pos/neg in test with 10 files each).

### 4.2 Environment
For testing, following two machines are used.

  - Ubuntu 20.04, Intel Xeon E5-1620, 16GB RAM (Master, Workers)
  - Ubuntu 20.04, Intel core i5-3550, 8GB RAM (Workers)

For baseline, used the first machine, and for MapReduce version, machines are conencted with ethernet cables through same switch.
The script used for baseline is `./baseline.cc` and compiled with `g++-9`.

Additionally, made sure other processes were idle or ran few processes which would not affect performance checks.

### 4.3 Result

The performance is tested with original dataset (100K files) and preprocessed dataset (50 files, see section 4.1).

The first table shows results from original dataset.

| Baseline | SimpleMapReduce</br>(1 machine, 1 master, 3 workers) | SimpleMapReduce</br>(2 machines, 1 master, 7 workers) |
|--|--|--|
|23.733 sec. | 8.343 sec. | 9.562 sec. |

and the following one is from preprocessed dataset.

| Baseline | SimpleMapReduce</br>(1 machine, 1 master, 3 workers) | SimpleMapReduce</br>(2 machines, 1 master, 7 workers) |
|--|--|--|
|22.295 sec. | 7.708 sec. | 6.166 sec. |

The time in baseline becomes shorter after preprocessed,
because the task have to open much less files than the original one.

However, it still took relatively long time, whereas MapReduce versions took less time.

When reading 100K files, it involves many network communications which are overhead for this process,
so that running on 1 PC finished faster.

Whereas with preprocessed files, it has less communications so that it becomes the fastest.
